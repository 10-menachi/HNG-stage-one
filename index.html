        <h5 class="card-title">Become a mid-level React JS Developer</h5>
        <p class="card-description">
          In two years, I want to be a mid-level React JS developer, therefore
          I'll start by learning the basics of React, like JSX, components, and
          key hooks like useState and useEffect. After that, I'll learn state
          management with Redux or context API, emphasizing lifecycle techniques
          and efficiency optimizations. It will be essential to build projects,
          contribute to open-source, and study advanced subjects like SSR/SSG
          and use Jest and Cypress for testing. I'll keep up to date by reading
          blogs, taking classes, and interacting with the React community in
          order to keep learning and getting better. It will be important to
          hone my problem-solving and communication abilities and to put
          together a great portfolio to highlight my work.

        <h5 class="card-title">Improve my UX/UI design skills</h5>
        <p class="card-description">
          As a frontend developer, you may improve your UX/UI design abilities
          by taking small, deliberate actions over time. To start, I'll learn
          more about design aesthetics and user experience concepts in order to
          make interfaces that are easier to use and more aesthetically
          pleasing. To better develop designs, this entails analyzing user
          behavior, carrying out usability testing, and honing wireframing and
          prototyping techniques. Additionally, I'll improve my skills with
          design software like Sketch or Figma, learning how to build responsive
          layouts that put accessibility and usability first and unified design
          systems. I'll include design thinking into my frontend development
          approach by working directly with designers and iterating on their
          feedback. This will guarantee that applications not only work properly
          but also offer a smooth and delightful user experience across various
          devices and circumstances.

        <h5 class="card-title">Improving my Responsive Design Skills</h5>
        <p class="card-description">
          As a frontend developer, I may become more proficient at responsive
          design by taking a rigorous approach to properly adapt interfaces
          across various screen sizes and devices. To guarantee consistent and
          ideal user experiences, I will first concentrate on learning
          responsive design concepts, such as fluid grids, flexible pictures,
          and media queries. As part of this, you should practice responsive
          typography and layout strategies and make use of CSS Grid/Flexbox or
          Bootstrap frameworks for effective styling and positioning. I want to
          learn more about progressive enhancement and mobile-first tactics,
          which maximize usability and performance in a variety of user
          settings. As I hone my responsive design abilities, it will be
          essential for me to work closely with designers and take their
          comments into account. My goal is to produce aesthetically pleasing
          and fluid interfaces that adhere to accessibility guidelines and raise
          user satisfaction levels.

        <h5 class="card-title">Improve my personal brand and network</h5>
        <p class="card-description">
          Leveraging chances like the HNG internship to proactively expand my
          professional visibility and contacts within the industry is essential
          to improving my personal brand and network as a frontend developer.
          First and foremost, I plan to use the internship to demonstrate my
          abilities and contributions through project work and teamwork with
          mentors and other interns. I hope to interact with a wide range of
          experts and learn from seasoned mentors by actively taking part in HNG
          community events. Additionally, I'll use this platform to communicate
          my project results, thoughts, and learnings via presentations, blogs,
          and social media. Furthermore, I intend to pursue constructive
          criticism and mentorship from prominent industry figures in the HNG
          community, enhancing my abilities and broadening my professional
          connections to facilitate sustained career advancement in frontend
          development.
